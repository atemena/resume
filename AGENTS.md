# AGENT Instructions

These guidelines apply to the entire repository.

- After making changes, run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before committing. If they fail due to environment restrictions, mention this in the PR description.
- Then run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass. If tests fail, display the errors in the PR description.
- Keep all source code in TypeScript. Maintain existing formatting.
- Reference `TODO.md` for the project roadmap and update it when tasks are completed.
